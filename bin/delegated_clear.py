"""The Chief of Staff's clear under the owner's standing order (#661).

The owner's own `impact clear` lifts an impact hold at the pull request's head. The owner can also order, as a numbered standing order on a charter, that the Chief of Staff may clear
ordinary held pull requests and tell him after. This module is the CHECK of that delegated clear (the command and its audit are in `bin/fleet-switchboard`); it decides nothing else.
It is OFF unless the configuration (`delegated_clear`) names the order numbers that delegate a clear and the charter that holds them. It refuses: any caller but the Chief of Staff, an
order that is not listed or does not exist, a pull request whose owner-hold decision names a path of a class the matrix lists as never delegated (credentials, identity), one whose
independent review's class is a top tier class (credentials, identity or authority), one that changes ANY file of the clear code or of what it depends on (the daemon file included),
and anything it cannot read.

Pure: plain values in, a list of reasons out (empty means allowed). The classes and the clear code are DATA in the matrix file (`owner_hold.delegated_clear`): this module holds no path or class.
